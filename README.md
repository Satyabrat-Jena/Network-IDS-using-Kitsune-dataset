üõ°Ô∏è An Explainable and Tamper-Proof DDoS Detection Model
Using Kitsune Dataset and Ethereum Blockchain
This repository contains the implementation and analysis for an advanced, real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed specifically for IoT networks. The system leverages hybrid Deep Learning architectures for high-accuracy detection and integrates with the Ethereum blockchain for immutable forensic logging. Crucially, it employs SHAP-based Explainable AI (XAI) to provide transparency into the detection process, addressing the "black box" problem common in deep learning models.

‚ú® Key Features
Hybrid Deep Learning IDS: Combines CuDNN-LSTM and CNN-LSTM models to effectively capture both spatial (CNN) and temporal (LSTM) patterns in network traffic for superior real-time attack classification.

High Performance: Achieved state-of-the-art results on the challenging Kitsune IoT Network Attack Dataset, demonstrating exceptional accuracy across multiple attack scenarios (Mirai, SYN Flood, ARP MitM, etc.).

Explainable AI (XAI): Utilizes SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret model predictions, showing exactly which network features (e.g., packet size, flow metrics) contributed most to an attack decision.

Tamper-Proof Logging: Integrates with the Ethereum Blockchain via a Solidity Smart Contract to securely log all detected intrusion events (timestamp, source/destination IP, attack type), ensuring log data integrity and auditability against tampering.

Real-Time Capability: Optimized for speed using GPU-accelerated CuDNN layers for deployment in dynamic network configurations.

üíª Technical Architecture
The system operates in three main stages:

Detection Module: Network packet data from the Kitsune dataset is preprocessed and fed into the hybrid deep learning model (CNN-LSTM/CuDNN-LSTM).

Interpretation Module (XAI): Upon a successful attack detection, the SHAP algorithm generates an explanation detailing the feature contributions for that specific prediction.

Logging Module (Blockchain): The attack metadata and key forensic details are recorded onto an Ethereum private blockchain (e.g., Ganache) using Web3.py and a Solidity smart contract.
